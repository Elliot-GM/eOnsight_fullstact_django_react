# Bridge Management Project

## Introduction
This project is a Django application for managing bridge information, including their name, location, inspection date, status, and traffic load capacity.

## Installation
1. Install the dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Apply the migrations:
    python manage.py migrate

3. Start the development server:

## Usage
    Once the server is running, access the interface to manage bridges: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/bridges/`
    You can interact with the Bridge API endpoints to create, read, update, and delete bridge information.
